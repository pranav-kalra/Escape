The Scoobert Doobert Escape Room
Uh oh! It looks like we have a mystery in our hands.You(Shaggy), Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Scooby Doo are investigating a mystery in the middle of the woods. There seems to be a ghost around town haunting people.
You and the gang are somehow in the middle of the woods in front of a large castle.
go west
You travel behind the house and you see a window.
Fred says it is a good idea to go inside. You, with common sense, incessantly object, but Velma tosses a couple Scooby snacks inside and well ya gotta do what ya gotta do.
As soon as everyone walks in, the door slams closed. In the corner of the room, the scarce moonlight illuminates a grandfather clock. It is at the 6 o’clock position. You hear a sharp tick as the minutes hand moves: 30 minutes until who knows what.
go south
You see a desk with a photo
You have 29 turns left
You go to the desk and you grab the photo
look photo
You pick up the photo frame, showing what looks to be a married couple. A tall, brunette man wearing a checkered polo
 stands tall next to his cute, blonde wife. But in the background, you see a yellow suit which resembles some kind of creature?
You have 28 turns left
"Yikes," mutters Scooby.
You also see a button.
press button
A bookshelf in the corner swings open. It reveals a secret room. 
You have 27 turns left
go room
This isn’t much of a room, but more like a foyer. You see a kitchen, a staircase, and study.
You have 26 turns left
“Daphne and I will take the bedroom,” exclaims Fred.
 Gee, it’s not like they take the same place every time. I wonder what they’re gonna do there.
You and Scooby take the kitchen, naturally, because somehow your gut is like a black hole. Man, some people would 
kill -- sorry, wrong choice of words --  for that metabolism. Inside, you raid the kitchen. As you feast on what ever dares to 
 exist in the fridge. You have a choice on what to eat: a scrumptious-looking turkey, a thick saucy pizza, or a juicy hamburger.
eat
As you munch, you hear an ominous noise.
You have 25 turns left
“What was that Scoob?”
“Ruh Roh Raggy”
*GULP* “Ya me too buddy. Like Fred? Daphne? Velma? You guys there?”
A large monster jumps out. You remember that it looks exactly like the one from the photo.
 You and Scooby abandon all of that food and run back to the foyer. Somehow, the entire gang manages to 
crash into each other.
“Shaggy, Scooby?” Velma asks.
“Fred, Daphne?” Shaggy asks.
“We just saw a monster” Fred says.
“Us too”.
“Let’s set a trap for it.”

They make you the bait, because, why not. You are going to have to run and jump the tripwire in 5 seconds. 
After, you are going to flip the switch for the trap to let the rope catch the bad guy. Tell us “ready” when you are ready.

Good Going Gang
“Time to see who this bad guy really is.” Daphne yanks the mask off of its face.
“RUH ROH”
“JINKIES”
“ZOINKS”
“JEEPERS”
“F-“This is a PG SHOW!
It looks like the monster in this real case was Doug Winnie! He has been meddling with the town of APCS1st Per. with his monstrous 1 point quiz. I guess we can call this mystery closed.

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU BEAT THE ESCAPE ROOM.
